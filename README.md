I recently received an email about the [Hashnode + 1Password Hackathon](https://hashnode.com/hackathons/1password). I haven't entered a hackathon for a bit, so I figured this is a good time and it provided the impetus to start writing about modern software application development. And also...it's one of the requirements to enter the hackathon. ðŸ˜…

I will explore different 1Password and Passage authentication options through my articles on [Hashnode](https://builditdeploy.hashnode.dev/), [Substack](https://builditdeploy.substack.com/), and [Dev](https://dev.to/builditdeploy).

I am writing articles under the moniker `@BuildItDeploy`. You can find my online profile here => https://hashnode.com/@builditdeploy

## `Passage` Passwordless Authentication

The hackathon provides the option to utilize 1Password or Passage authentication. I haven't used Passage's _**passwordless authentication**_ so I'm using this opportunity to test it out.

## Deployed App
